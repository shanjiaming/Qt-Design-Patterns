/*In general, code substitution macros should be avoided. They are regarded as evil by
most serious C++ programmers. Preprocessor macros are used mostly for the
following:
1. #ifndef/#define/#endif wrapping around header files to avoid multiple
inclusion
2. #ifdef/#else/#endif to conditionally compile some parts of code but not
others
3. __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros for debugging and profiling
As a rule, inline functions should be used instead of macros for code substitutions.
The exce pti on t o t his r ul e is t he use of Qt macr os t hat i nsert code i nt o pr ogra ms t hat
use certain Qt classes. It is easy to see why some C++ experts look suspiciously at Qtâ€™s
use of macros.*/
